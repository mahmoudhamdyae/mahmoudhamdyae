A mobile software engineer specializing in Flutter development, I'm committed to building high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications. My comprehensive background in mobile development, including Android (Java/Kotlin), KMP, and iOS (Swift), allows me to approach projects with a strong understanding of the mobile ecosystem. My foundation in core programming principles (data structures, algorithms, SOLID, OOP, design patterns) ensures the development of scalable and maintainable solutions.
